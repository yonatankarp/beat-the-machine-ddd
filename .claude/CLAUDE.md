## Project Overview

This is a Spring Boot application built with Kotlin and Gradle, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

## Key Technologies

- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Build Tool**: Gradle
- **JDK**: 21+
- **Architecture**: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Project Structure

- `beat-the-machine/` - Main application module
- `beat-the-machine-domain/` - Domain layer module
- `buildSrc/` - Build configuration
- `docs/` - Documentation

## Domain Model Summary

The Beat The Machine application implements an AI-generated image guessing game following DDD principles.

### Game Context
Players view AI-generated images and attempt to guess the original text prompt that was used to generate the image. The game provides feedback on each word guess similar to Wordle-style games:
- **Green**: Correct word in correct position
- **Yellow**: Correct word in wrong position
- **Red**: Word not in the original prompt

### Value Objects (Immutable)
- **Word**: Single word with validation (no spaces), case normalization, and obfuscation capability
- **Prompt**: Multi-word text prompt that generated the AI image, with infix functions for natural language (`prompt contains word`)
- **ImageUrl**: Validated URL pointing to the AI-generated image
- **GameId**: UUID-based unique identifier for game sessions
- **Guess**: Collection of words representing a player's complete guess (supports varargs construction)
- **WordFeedback**: Combines a word with its status (CORRECT_POSITION, WRONG_POSITION, WRONG_WORD)
- **GuessResult**: Collection of WordFeedback representing complete evaluation of a guess

### Entities
- **Riddle**: Contains the prompt and image, with business logic to evaluate guesses and return detailed feedback
- **Game**: (Planned) Aggregate root managing multiple riddles and overall game state

### Core Business Behaviors

#### Riddle Evaluation
- **Guess Processing**: Evaluates complete guesses against the original prompt
- **Position-based Feedback**: Determines if words are correct, in wrong position, or completely wrong
- **Rich Domain Logic**: Encapsulates all guess evaluation logic within the Riddle entity

#### Word Management
- **Single Word Constraint**: Prevents multi-word inputs in individual Word objects
- **Case Normalization**: Automatically converts all words to lowercase for consistent comparison
- **Obfuscation**: Words can render themselves as masked strings (e.g., "hello" â†’ "-----")

#### Domain Language
- **Expressive API**: Uses infix functions for natural language (`prompt contains word`)
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Method names and concepts directly reflect business terminology

### Business Rules Enforced
- **Word Validation**: Single words only, no spaces allowed
- **URL Validation**: Image URLs must be valid format
- **Prompt Integrity**: Prompts cannot be blank
- **Case Insensitivity**: All text comparisons normalized to lowercase
- **Rich Feedback**: Every guess returns detailed positional feedback for UI rendering

### Domain Invariants
- Words are always single tokens without spaces
- Prompts are always non-blank normalized text
- Game sessions have unique, immutable identities
- Riddle evaluation always returns feedback for every guessed word
- All domain objects are properly validated upon creation

## Development Principles

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
This project MUST follow Test-Driven Development practices with strict Red-Green-Refactor cycles:

#### TDD Cycle Requirements:
- **RED**: Write ONE minimal failing test that defines the next small piece of functionality
- **GREEN**: Write the minimal code needed to make that specific test pass (avoid implementing more than required)
- **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping all tests green (mandatory step that cannot be skipped)
- **Repeat**: Continue with the next small increment

#### TDD Best Practices:
- Use the `red-test-creator` subagent to create failing tests first
- Use the `tdd-green-test` subagent to implement minimal code to make tests pass
- Use the `tdd-refactoring-agent` subagent to refactor code while keeping tests green
- Use the `qa-coverage-enforcer` subagent to ensure comprehensive test coverage
- **NEVER implement multiple requirements in one cycle**
- **ALWAYS complete the refactor phase** - skipping refactoring violates TDD principles
- ALL new functionality must be developed using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle

#### Test Structure Requirements:
- Use Given/When/Then comments for test structure clarity
- Use Kotest assertions (`shouldBe`, `shouldThrow`) instead of JUnit assertions
- Prefer `.not()` over `!` for boolean negation in Kotlin for better readability
- Remove implementation comments from tests (keep only Given/When/Then structure comments)

### Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)
ALL features MUST be validated using ATDD:
- **Feature-level tests** that validate complete user scenarios
- **End-to-end integration tests** using TestContainers
- **API contract tests** for all endpoints
- **Behavior-driven scenarios** using Cucumber or Kotest BDD
- Tests must be written from the user's perspective, not implementation details

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
This project strictly follows DDD principles and patterns:

#### Required DDD Concepts:
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects representing descriptive aspects of the domain
- **Entities**: Objects with identity that can change over time
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of domain objects treated as a single unit
- **Aggregate Roots**: The only entry point to an aggregate
- **Domain Events**: Events that represent business-significant occurrences
- **Rich Domain Models**: Business logic encapsulated within domain objects
- **Domain Services**: Operations that don't naturally fit within entities or value objects
- **Repositories**: Abstractions for data access that speak the domain language
- **Factories**: Objects responsible for creating complex domain objects
- **Specifications**: Business rules that can be combined and tested

#### DDD Architecture Layers:
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic, entities, value objects, domain services
- **Application Layer**: Orchestrates domain objects, handles use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Technical implementations (persistence, external services)
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface and API controllers

#### DDD Tactical Patterns (ALL REQUIRED):
- Bounded Contexts with clear boundaries
- Ubiquitous Language throughout the codebase
- Anti-Corruption Layers when integrating with external systems
- Domain Events for decoupling and side effects
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) where appropriate

#### DDD Implementation Guidelines:
- **Rich Domain Models**: Avoid anemic domain models - business logic belongs in domain objects
- **Value Objects as Kotlin Value Classes**: Use `@JvmInline value class` with private constructors when validation/transformation is needed
- **Expressive Domain Language**: Use infix functions and extension functions for natural business language
- **Proper Dependency Direction**: Higher-level concepts should depend on lower-level ones (e.g., Prompt contains Word, not Word knows about Prompt)
- **Domain Object Construction**: Use companion object factories when you need validation, transformation, or multiple construction patterns (like varargs)
- **Nested Enums**: Place enums inside the classes where they make semantic sense (e.g., `WordFeedback.Status`)
- **Business Method Naming**: Method names should reflect business operations, not technical implementations

## Important Development Guidelines

### Library and Technology Usage:
- **NEVER make assumptions** about which libraries or frameworks are available
- **ALWAYS check existing dependencies** in build.gradle.kts before suggesting or using any library
- **ONLY use libraries explicitly listed** in the "Required Libraries" section above
- **If a library is needed but not listed**, ask the user before proceeding
- **Check neighboring files and imports** to understand existing patterns and frameworks

### Architecture Verification:
- Use **Konsist** (not ArchUnit) for architecture testing
- Verify all architectural constraints with Konsist tests
- Ensure DDD layer boundaries are enforced through Konsist rules

## Claude Code Behavior Guidelines

### Code Comments Policy:
- **NEVER add code comments** unless explicitly requested by the user
- Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure
- Comments should only be added when the user specifically asks for them

### Task Execution and Planning:
- **ALWAYS create and show an execution plan** before starting any multi-step task
- **ALWAYS use the TodoWrite tool** to track task progress and show execution status
- **ALWAYS update todo status in real-time** as tasks are completed
- **SHOW PROGRESS VISIBILITY** to the user throughout task execution
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, trackable steps
- Mark tasks as in_progress, completed, or pending to provide clear status updates
